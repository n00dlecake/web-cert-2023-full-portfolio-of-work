                        <p>Wombats are short legged,muscular marsupials native to Australia. They are mainly nocturnal, emerging at night to feed on grasses, herbs, bark, and roots.There are three species of wombat: the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus) is the most numerous and widespread and has a bare nose. The northern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus krefftii) and the southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) are distinguished by their hairy noses, softer fur, and larger ears. Wombats grow to about 40 inches long and can weigh between 44 and 77 pounds. They're unusual, even for marsupials. Read on to learn what makes these cute, pudgy critters so special.</p>

                            <p> ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​The common wombat, also known as the bare-nosed wombat,  is the largest burrowing herbivorous mammal. Indeed, it is such an accomplished burrower that early settlers called it a 'badger', a term that is still heard today. However, the closest relative of the wombat is, in fact, the koala. With its short tail and legs, characteristic waddle and 'cuddly' appearance, the wombat is one of the most endearing of Australia's native animals. </p>

                <h2>Habitat</h2>

                <!-- Image carousel -->
                <h3>Common Wombats inhabit sub-alpine heath at altitudes
                    of up to 1800 m, sub-alpine woodland, wet forest, dry
                    forest, woodland, coast scrub and wet heath.
                    The distribution of the Common Wombat mainly
                    depends on the availability of suitable burrow sites that
                    are near their food sites.
                    Although they are not territorial in their sleeping
                    arrangements, they are territorial about feeding areas
                    and will scent mark their territory and defend it
                    aggressively using vocalization and aggressive
                    behaviour.
                    They graze between 3 and 8 hours a night, during
                    which time they may travel many kilometres and visit up
                    to 4 burrows. Over several weeks they have been found
                    visit up to 13 burrows in their home territory. 
                    </h3>
                    <h2>Diet</h2>
                    <h3>A wombat's diet can consist of coarse native grasses,
                        sedges, rushes, succulent plant roots and tubers, and
                        pasture grasses.
                        Wombats are mostly nocturnal, usually coming out at
                        night to graze when the temperature is lower. However,
                        in cold periods they may be seen out during the day
                        either grazing or basking in the sun. They can graze for up to 8 hours a night and travel quite far from their burrows in search of food.</h3>

No joke: these critters actually excrete cube shaped poop!

                                    <li>The wombats rear end is really their main form of defence against predators. When a predator is near, these big booty mammals dive down their burrows and block off the entrance with their butts. As their booties mainly consist of cartilage, they are very resistant to scratches and bites. They can also crush predator's skulls with their behinds.</li>
                                    
                                    <li> A group of wombats is called a wisdom of wombats a mob of wombats or a colony of wombats. The name wombat comes from the Darug language, spoken by the Traditional Owners of Sydney.</li>
