    <h2>Getting a Student Loan and Allowance</h2>

    <h3>Unfortunately I wasn’t able to get an exchange program as my tertiary didn’t offer any exchanges to Australia, and I wasn’t ready to go further beyond, so I discussed with a lecturer about transferring into online studies but unfortunately they didn’t offer that for my degree. Thankfully, at the time I was only doing a certificate so I was able to withdraw my application for my degree and apply to a new institute. So, as of next year I’ll be doing my bachelors in communication design fully online with the Media Design School.</h3>

    <h3>I have friends who have started the year studying in person but transitioned into online studies. It all just depends on your degree and your tertiary, so it’s differently worth bringing up. </h3>

    <h3>Now, with that. Before applying to MDS, I applied to a uni in Oz and was accepted but they couldn’t give me a student loan or an allowance as I hadn’t lived there for 10 years so I’d have to take out a personal loan, which I wasn’t willing to do. What I would recommend if you’re in the same situation as me is to change tertiaries. You don’t need to restart your degree from day one, you can do a credit transfer. For example if you completed your first year you could transfer those credits to start your second year at a different tertiary.</h3>
  
    <h3>e best part about doing an NZ degree while living overseas, is that studylink still can provide you with a loan and even an allowance. Applying for your loan is still the same process (unless you’re doing an exchange or moving into online studies then it doesn’t matter) but for the allowance that’s a different process. You will need to fill out this document below. You’ll only need to fill out part one then have a staff member fill out part two for you. You can ignore part three completely, and part four you’ll only need if you’d like an agent, which I didn’t go with. </h3>
