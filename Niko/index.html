                    <p> Cuttlefish and cuttles belong to the order of marine mollusks called Sepiida. They belong to the same family as squid, nautiluses, and octopuses. The unique internal shell called the cuttlebone, which is unique to cuttlefish, is used to control buoyancy. </p>

                        <p class="border">Marine cephalopods of the Sepioidea order include cuttlefish. They resemble squid and octopuses in close relation, but they may be identified by the thick, calcified shell within that is termed a cuttlebone. The length of the approximately 100 species of cuttlefish, which have somewhat flattened bodies encircled by slender fins, varies from 2.5 to 90 cm (1 to 35 inches). Each species has eight arms for grasping prey and two longer tentacles that can be drawn into two pouches. Suction disks are located on the arms and on larger pads near the tips of the tentacles.</p>

The giant cuttlefish is native to temperate and subtropical waters of Australia, from Brisbane in Queensland to Shark Bay in Western Australia and Tasmania to the south. It occurs on rocky reefs, seagrass beds, and sand and mud seafloor to a depth of 100 m (330 ft).</p></div>

They are distributed around the globe, and over 120 unique cuttlefish species have been discovered. Cuttlefish are able to match colors and surface textures of their surrounding environments by adjusting the pigment and iridescence of their skin, which is composed of several layers. On the skin surface, chromatophores (tiny sacs filled with red, yellow, or brown pigment) absorb light of various wavelengths</p> </div>
