                                    <p>Bloch Pointe Shoes are a great line of shoes expecially for younger dancers/beginners to pointe. They are lightweight and have a flexible shank, this makes them easy to roll up en pointe for beginners allowing the dancer to fully move through their foot.

                                    Since 1932, when our founder Jacob Bloch created his very first pointe shoe, Bloch has consistently led the way in innovating these iconic ballet essentials. Our pointe shoes adorn the feet of renowned dance professionals in companies worldwide, as well as countless aspiring ballet students.
                                    Crafted by hand from luxurious satin, Bloch's ballet pointe shoes harmonise impeccable craftsmanship with dancer-centric comfort. Each Bloch pointe shoe is meticulously designed, considering every aspect of its anatomy.</p>

                                    <p>Freed pointe shoes are well known for being on the softer side and often die easily. These shoes can be great for beginners who already have a strong arch base they have a lightweight shank and box and the soft shank allows for the dancer to move through their feet properly. However the soft shank can also make it hard for the dancer to role en pointe and wont give the dancer much support through the arch. They are also suited to advanced or professional dancers who already have a strong foor and arch that can support itself, however they are not really a class shoe and some professionals use them predominantly as their stage performance shoe, as they dont really need to be broken in.

Gaynors are made from advanced flexible polymers which means they don't need to be 'broken into' and last 3-6 times longer than normal pointe shoes. They offer 5 different stiffness options for their shoes shanks with additional options if neede. The shanks are already pre-arched which offers support and a nice line of the foot. Usually these shoes are suited to more experienced dancers who have been on pointe for a while. Gaynors are one of the only brands that have a right and left side to each pair with the draw-string going on the inside of each shoe. They cost double the price initially but end up lasting longer for the dancer.

These shoes have interchangeable shanks that allow the shoe to be customized to have a harder or softer shank depending on the individuals foot or dancing context. This sets them apart from other brands as no other shoes can do this. Not only is it handy for changing between class work and performances but it also allows the dancer to customize their shoe to the variation or dance. These shoes are also more financially sustainable as the whole shoe often doesn;t need to be replaced just the shank, they also are convenient as they don't need to be worn-in as you can start with a softer shank and not worry about replacing the whole shoe.

                        <p><h6>Box:</h6>  
The toes should be able to lie flat in the box of the shoe when you foot is flat on the floor. However the shoe should be snug and the foot should not come over the top of the box when en pointe. A good measure is that you should be able to fit one finger in the shoe any more and box is probably to round for your foot type. 
<h6>Wings:</h6> The wings should be inline with the big toe joint, if you have longer toes you will need a longer box, however if it is to long you will find it more difficult to move through your demi pointe.
<h6>Vamp:</h6> If the vamp of you shoe is to short your foot could feel like it is falling out of the front of the shoe. However to long and it could make it harder to move through demi pointe.
<h6>Heel:</h6> The seam of the heel should reach the top of the heel bone. You don't want you shoe to be at risk of falling off but you should be mindful that if you pull your drawstring to tight it can cause Achilles issues. If your shoe is the right size you shouldn't need to have your drawstring pulled extremely tight, if your shoe is too lose otherwise it is probably to big. You will quickly find out if it is too short on your heel as it will keep popping off when you rise.
<h6>Shank:</h6>  The shank should fit the curve of the foot when en pointe. If the shank of the shoe is twisting, check the alignment of the foot first. As long as the box is sitting square and the foot is in good alignment, it should be ok. Often twisting of the shoe is due to the shank not conforming to the shape of the arch and can be remedied by breaking in the heel of the shoe before wearing. However, the shank may also twist on the foot if the box is too narrow. A shank comes in many different strengths and it is important to take into account pointe experience and dance hours when deciding on a shank, however you often don't know which strength will suit your foot until you have tried a pair of shoes. 
<h6>length:</h6>  To check the length fold the heel seam underneath the shoe, and check the foot en pointe. The shank should just come short of the heel if it is too long it can cause sagging of at the back of the shoe, too short and the foot will have less support en pointe. 
<h6>Plie:</h6> 
When trying on shoes you should plie in second as this make your foot it longest and widest, when at your plie depth your toes should still lie flat with in the shoe. 
<h6>Stand On Pointe:</h6> 
Finally you should try stepping en pointe and checking that there are no particular pressure points against the foot, these will often turn into places that rub/give you blisters. If the shoe gapes you can tighten the drawstring and if that doesn't work you might need a narrower shoe. The foot should also feel supported in the box if your foot sinks down a lot into the box it is likely that your shoe is to wide for your foot.

                        <p><h6>Book a Fitting:</h6> 
It is a great idea to book a shoe fitting at a dance store or ballet shoe specialist, especially if it is your first pair or if you are coming back from an injury. If you are already on pointe and looking for a new pair it is helpful to take an old pair of shoes with you. This allows the fitter to see how your foot wears in the shoe and you can point out what you don't like about the shoe. This allows you the best chance to find a good fitting shoe.</p>

                         <p><h6>1</h6> Cut The Ribbon:
Ribbon bundles are sold in one long 2 1/4 metre length so the ribbon needs to be cut in half and then in half again so their are four peices, one for each side of the shoe.
<h6>2</h6> Place The Ribbon:
To attach the ribbons at the correct angle, fold the back of the shoe forward and down, then mark each side of the shoe with a pencil on the cotton lining in the angle made. Then place the end of the ribbon at the marked position at an angle with the long end of the ribbon pointing towards the box of the shoe. You want about 2cm of ribbon sitting inside the shoe, pin the ribbon in place with a sewing needle.
<h6>3</h6> Sew The Ribbon:
Then with a basic stitch sew the ribbon onto the shoe. You want to sew around all three sides of the ribbon and across the top of the ribbon into the binding.You want to be sewing through the cotton lining but not through the satin. When sewing into the binding you want to fold the ribbon down into the shoe and sew along the outside of the ribbon this allows you so see where you are sewing into the binding, this is important as you don't want to sew into the drawstring because then you wont be able to adjust your shoes. Depending on the strength and thickness of the thread you are using it can be beneficial to sew around the ribbon twice. Finish your stitch with a solid double knot.
<h6>4</h6> Secure The Ends:
Finally take you matches or lighter and lightly melt the free end of your ribbons. This will make sure that the ribbon doesnt fray.

For extra support the ribbon can be sewn further down the shoe closer to the inner sole at the same position. </p>

<p><h6>Elastic</h6>
Sewing Elastics is very similar to sewing on your ribbons, 
but there are two different methods that you can use.


<h6>Criss Cross Method</h6>
<h6>1</h6> Measure The Elastic: 
Place your foot in the shoe, with one end of the elastic positioned to the front and side of your outer ankle, stretch the elastic across the top of your foot and place the other end at the back of your inner ankle. You want the elastic to be firm across your ankle but no to tight. Add aproximately 1/2 this length to the elastic length again before you cut the elastic this is to make sure you have enough elastic to sew to the shoe. Cut four pieces of elastic at this length.
<h6>2</h6> Place Elastic:
Fold the heel of the shoe forward and down and mark each side with a pencil. Place the elastic at this position with the long end angled slighty toward the front of the shoe.(If you have ribbons sewn onto your shoe already you want to place your elastic infront of your ribbon)Dont place your elastic over the side seam of the shoe as this is hard to sew through. Once placed pin the elastic in to the shoe. You then want to place the other end of the elastic at the back of the shoe. On the opposite side of the shoe place the elastic end right to the side of the heel seam near the sole of the shoe, the elastic should angle toward the front of the shoe, also pin this in place. Now you are ready to sew.
<h6>3</h6> Sewing Your Elastic:
Fold the heel of the shoe underneath exposing the inside of the shoe and loop the elastic under the bottom of the shoe, this will allow you to see what you are sewing. Then with a basic stitch sew around the edge of your elastic and across the top straight below the top binding seam. Make sure you are only sewing through the cotton lining and not through the outter satin. Finish your stitch with a solid double knot.                                                         


<h6>Single Loop Style</h6></p>
<1> Measure Your Elastic:
Place your foot in your shoe and loop the elastic firmly around your ankle with both ends of your elastic sitting at the back of either side of your ankle. Add about 1/2 this length to the elastic again before you cut it, this is so that you have elastic to sew on the inside of the shoe. 
<h6>2</h6> Place Elastic:
place the ends of your elastic about a finger width away from either side of the heel seam slightly andgle toward the front of the shoe. Once happy with the placement pin the elastic to the shoe. Now you are ready to sew.
<h6>3</h6> Sew Elastic:
Fold the heel of the shoe underneath exposing the inside of the shoe and loop the elastic under the bottom of the shoe, this will allow you to see what you are sewing. Then with a basic stitch sew around the edge of your elastic and across the top straight below the top binding seam. Make sure you are only sewing through the cotton lining and not through the outter satin. Finish your stitch with a solid double knot.

                        <p><h6>First-time On Pointe</h6>
                            
The first rule about breaking in your pointe shoes is to wear them frequently. Wearing them around the house and walking on demi pointe, allows the shoe to mold to your foot become comfortable and softens the demi pointe so that it is easyer to roll through your foot.
One of the primary reasons that pointe can be painful is because of the stiffness of the box of the shoe. To help speed up this softening process you can gently crush the box of the shoe by stepping on it with your heel. You want to do this very gently, just enough that it can bend around your foot straight off your goal is to not destroy the box completely but just begin the softening process. 

One of the other things you can do to help make your feet more comfortable is to bend the shank of the shoe, which greatly improves the comfort level. To identify where your natural arch "breaks" the shoe, try doing some tendus to the side, leaning heavily onto the shoe. the remove the shoe and following the shape that your foot has made you want to gently bend the shoe with your hands. Keep in mind that no matter what type of shoe you are purchasing, they are going to have a different level of stiffness to them. This depends on the style and foot shape, Most shoes are also hand-made and therefore will vary from shoe to shoe no matter the brand.

If you feel pressure from one part of the block you can add a bit of water onto the shoe in that area and it will soften up.
It is important to be careful when breaking in your shoes and not over do it as you dont want to manipulate the shoe in a way that doesnt suit your foot, breaking in your shoes to much will also cause your shoe to wear out faster. Over time, heat and perspiration from working in the shoe will continue to mould the shoe to your foot. </p>

                        <p><h6>Other Methods</h6>
There are many ways that dancers like to break in their shoes. Professional dancers form a method that they feel works specifically for their feet and often they break shoes in differently for each foot. Some of these methods can be quite experimental however this process makes their shoe performance ready straight away.</p>

<h6>Prep</h6>       
When painting your point shoes with any method you should first stuff them with somthing such as newspaper so that the shoe holds its shape, only remove the stuffing after the shoe has dried. You should also make sure that you have somthing down to protect the surface that you are working on.

                    <p><h6>Foundation</h6>
By using foundation on your pointe shoes you can make sure that they match your exact skin tone enabling the shoe to become a true extension of the leg. This is a very popular style and method with dance teachers around the world.

<h6>-</h6>Powder Foundation: Using a powder foundation that matches your skintone and a makeup brush, brush the power into the satin of your pointe shoes. You may need to brush it in quite hard to get it to stick to the fabric, if this is not working with your foundation you can use a damp/slightly wet cloth or sponge to rub the power onto the shoes. This is one of the more popular methods of coloring pointe shoes as it is easy to get a even application over the whole shoe and gives it a nice matte finish.
<h6>-</h6>Liquid Foundation: Using a foundation that matches your skin tone, take a sponge or old cloth and lightly dab it into the foundation and then rub it into the shoe. You don't want to gave alot of foundation on your cloth as the satin of the shoe absorbes the foundation well and it will be hard to spread evenly. Although this method works liquid foundation isn't the best method as the satin absorbes it well and you don't end up with an even applicaion. 

<h6>Pancaking</h6>
Pancaking is another popular method, pancake is a special shoe paint that comes as a solid block. You apply it to the shoe by using a damp sponge and a drop of water to loosen the paint, you gently dab it onto the shoe. You want to be careful to transfer as little liquid as possible in this process as to protect the integrity of the shoe. if pancake is not available to you, pink calamite lotion works just as well using the same method. once the shoes have dried knocking the shoes together gets ride of the excess paint.

                        <p><h6>Reuse Your Ribbons & Elastics</h6>
All pointe shoes die eventually, but your ribbons and elastic has a much longer user life. When you shoe die simply cut the stitchs hold the ribbons and elastic in place and they are ready to use again. Not only does this leave you with a precut set of ribbons and elastic to use on your next pair of shoes but also saves you alot of money.

<h6>Petit Pas</h6>
Petit Pas is a line of accessories made from the leather and satin of dead pointe shoes fro the dancers at The School Of American Ballet. They deconstruct and sanitize before reworking the shoes into bracelets, mini hairpin purses and more. This a great sustainable way to stop shoes from ending up in landfills and could be an interesting home project to have ago at.

<h6>Decorating</h6>
Instead of throwing your pointe shoes away turn them into an art project by painting or acessorizing them.

                      Anneke Nahkies is an artist who repurposes pointe shoes. She uses mostly used shoes that have already fulfilled their original purpose, turning them into works of art that give the shoes a new life. Anneke started ballet as an adult to aid her recovery from anorexia and has shared her story with her followers along with her amazing works of art. She began treatment for her eating disorder in 2002 and through this process she realised that it is very hard to remove behavours and impulses if you havent got anythign else to do. Anneke has struggled with sharing her content online " My mental health manifests in a way that I want to hide-and this was the complete opposite" this eventually lead to her stepping back from social media and limiting what she shared with her followers "After such a rough few years within my recovery I've also realised I want to exist more 'quietly' for now, which for me means I'm not really wanting to have much of an online presence. I'm trying to live more for the moment, and not simply chronically online."
                      <hr> 
                      Currently she has moved onto other forms of art and also begun ice skating, she still has an active blog where she shares updates about how she is doing.
                      She began working on pointe shoes in 2017 when she decided to take part in the 100 day art project. This soon turned into a challenge to repurpose 100 pairs of pointe shoes in her own time. "I tried to research what I wanted to do and actually found very little-certainly nothing that helped me work out how to do the shoes. So I bought some satin fabric and started experimenting on that first only to realise that it was VERY different from working on canvas or paper-as inks etc bleed." Anneke at first had trouble sourcing shoes, she ended up collecting her classmates used shoes and was very fortunate that a few shops and brands donated her shoes that they were not able to sell. 
                      <hr>
                      Anneke's shoes very quickly became popular on instagram and facebook gaining a large following with friends of the Royal New Zealand Ballet reaching out to her which lead to her doing some promotional work on the production of The Piano. 
                      In March 2018 Anneke had her first solo exhibition, with approximately 120 pairs of pointe shoes, at Thistle Hall in Wellington.
